## Bus Mall

This is an app that lets people vote on one of three products and then generates three more products each time one is clicked.  It keeps track of the answer data and shows it in list form as well as in a chart.  It also stores the data locally.

### Reflections and Comments
This was an interesting project.  It took me about 5.5 hours.  I enjoyed learning how to randomize images and how to populate a chart with user data.
